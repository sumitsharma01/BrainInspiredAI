# BrainInspiredAI
A research project focused on mimicking human brain functions to detect and reduce AI hallucinations, improving the reliability and interpretability of generative models.


Core Concepts to Include

- Brain-Inspired Architecture: Use modular networks (memory, reasoning, decision-making layers).

- Thinking Instinct Module: A meta-controller that decides when to "pause and think" instead of instantly answering.

- Hallucination Reduction: Use grounding mechanisms (retrieval, self-check loops, or neuro-symbolic methods).

- Execution Layer: An "action network" to simulate brain’s motor output (code execution, planning).

- Learning Guide: Step-by-step documentation, starting from theory → simple examples → full architecture.


🚀 First Milestone would be:

- Create a minimal prototype:

- Input: A reasoning question.

- Model: A network with a "thinking loop" (iterative reasoning like a brain).

- Output: A grounded answer with reasoning trace.

- Add documentation explaining brain-inspired principles behind the design.

🔧 Technologies to use

- PyTorch for custom networks.

- LangChain / LlamaIndex (to integrate LLMs).

- Neuro-Symbolic Logic for reasoning.

- OpenAI / HuggingFace models as base layers.

- ReAct-style thinking loops or custom memory modules
